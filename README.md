# Web-Terminal
A simple terminal-style display made with CSS and JavaScript

## Usage
Simply open index.html in your browser.

To transpile and minify the JavaScript:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Features
* Responsive CSS
* Prints characters one at a time.

## Flaws
* Not easy to customize the font size and screen size
* The number of characters per line varies slightly with window width.
* Google Chrome sizes the height differently, sometimes leaving room for a partial line at the top of the screen. Not sure if there's a way to fix this.
